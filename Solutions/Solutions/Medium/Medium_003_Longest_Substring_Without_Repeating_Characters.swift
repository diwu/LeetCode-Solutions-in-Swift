#3 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Level: medium

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc", which the length is 3. For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.

     "Because of the way Swift strings are stored, the String type does not support random access to its Characters via an integer index — there is no direct equivalent to NSStringʼs characterAtIndex: method. Conceptually, a String can be seen as a doubly linked list of characters rather than an array."
     
     By creating and storing a seperate array of the same sequence of characters,
     we could hopefully achieve amortized O(1) time for random access.
